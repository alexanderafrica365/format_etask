## Settings

### Activity completion

Activity completion is enabled by default in Moodle 3.9. You can manage `Activity completion` in each of the course activity.

### Plugin settings

You can edit plugin setting by visiting `Site administration` -> `Plugins` -> `Course formats` -> `eTask topics format`. There is **one configurable field**.

#### Registered due date modules

![eTask-plugin-settings_mdl_36](https://bitbucket.org/repo/obeE8n/images/3581889433-eTask-pluginSettings_mdl_36.png)

**Registered due date modules** provide a list of activity modules and specifies in which module's database field is the due date value stored. It helps you to menage modules with due date information used in activity popover.

### Course format settings

You can edit course format settings by `Edit settings` in the course. There are **five configurable fields**.

#### eTask private view

**By default**, private view **is active -- students can see only their own grades**. Othervise they see grades of all the students.

#### eTask progress bars 

**Motivates your students** even more with **progress bars Completed and Passed** placed in the activity popover. Students can see progress of completed activities as well as passed activities. Private view is back in a play! No private data like grades of the other students -- motivational progress bars only. Progress bars are **calculated by default**. Because of the activity popover consistency, progress bars are visible all the time -- if progress bars are not allowed, they are not calculated but still visible with zero values.

#### eTask students per page

**Number of students per page** allows to change the number of students visible on each page of eTask grading table (default value is `10`). **Pagination is displayed** below the eTask grading table.

#### eTask activities sorting

**Customize the course settings** by your preferences and sort activities by the latest, by the oldest or as they are in the course.

#### eTask placement

**Above or below the course sections?** Choose your ideal grading table placement.

### Highlighting of grading values

**Highlights grading value** by different statuses (`completed`, `passed`, `failed` or without highlighting if grade to pass is not defined). Completed status is applied through the activity completion in the activity settings. The status completed is displayed until a grade is entered, then 'passed' or 'failed' status is shown according to the grade to pass. Otherwise no status if grade to pass is not set.

### Permissions

**Strictly defined access permissions** for all versions of eTask. **GDPR ready plugin.** It is possible to manage permissions in course. There are three access levels:

- **non-editing teacher** (read only for all the data) and
- **student** (read only for the data in the context of a private view).

Switching the user roles provide real view on grading table in permissions context.
