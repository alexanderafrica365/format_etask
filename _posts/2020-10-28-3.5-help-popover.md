## From version 2.0

For those who use the plugin without training and have the capability to update course settings, we provide new eTask topics help,
which is a part of the standard plugin installation. In this popover, a link to the plugin page is placed that refers to this site
helping users with using this plugin.

The plugin page may contain some questionnaires and all the eTask topics format's users are welcome to participate – data from
these questionnaires will help us to improve this plugin.

You can see, the popover contains `Release` and `version` information – these are really important when you are reporting some
issues.
