## Grades statuses

Do you know students can be more motivated if they know other students completed/passed some activities? We identified and
implement this factor as a strong motivational element of the educational experience.

## Progress bars

If you turned on `Student privacy` in the [course format settings]({{ "/1-get-started/1.3-settings/" | absolute_url }}), the
student can only see his/her grades in the grading table, i.e. only one row in the grading table.

As we identified the importance of the ratio between completed/passed activities in relation to the number of course/group
participants, we decided to calculate these progress bars from the complex data set even if only one student is shown in the
grading table. This is really important for student motivation, as mentioned above.

## Activity completion

Since the `Completed` status takes place in a motivational environment, it is good to know, how to set up the activity completion
feature. You can set up activity completion while you are adding/editing gradable activity. If activity completion is not available
here, please check [how to enable completion tracking]({{ "/4-common-problems/4.3-completed-status/" | absolute_url }}).
