4. visit the `Versions` tab and choose the version supporting your Moodle installation,
5. click `Install now` button, choose the registered site for installation and
![Installation from plugins directory]({{ "/images/installation/from-plugins-directory.png" | absolute_url }})
6. go through the installation wizard to finish the installation.

            ├── ...

            ├── ...
            ├── renderer.php
            └── version.php
~~~

2. extract the files to the folder named `etask`,
3. copy the `etask` folder to `course/format/` directory on your server,
4. login to the administration and run the installation,
5. optionally update the settings of this module and
6. set course format to `eTask topics format`.
