## Registered due date modules

You can optionally configure the plugin in `Site administration` / `Plugins` / `Course formats` / `eTask topics format`. Only one
configuration field is available and specifies in which module's database field is the due date value stored. Do not remove default
value - extend it if necessary.

![Configuration]({{ "/images/configuration/registered-due-date-modules.png" | absolute_url }})

For example, if you have `lucson` activity module installed, you can find the due date field named `deadline` in the database. Just
extend `Registered due date modules` with value `lucson:deadline`. While each entry is comma-separated value (`, `), module and due
date fields are separated with `:` (colon) - see an example with default value below.

assign:duedate, forum:duedate, lesson:deadline, lucson:deadline, quiz:timeclose, scorm:timeclose, workshop:submissionend

## Impact

This configuration has an impact on the `Due date` placed in the grade item popover. This information is really important from the
student's view and helps them meet the deadline for completing the graded activity.
