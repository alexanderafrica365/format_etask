## From version 2.0

As the activities are changing in time, we added the `Last modified date` indicating the change of activity for the students. We
also described better what the progress bars values say and extend the `Grade to pass` with `max.` grade information. In addition,
the `Grade to pass` setting has been moved directly to the popover â€“ no `Turn editing on` needed.

A popover is shown on hover/tap the grade item shortcut. The activity detail link is from the grade item name. You can edit
activity settings by a click on the `Show more ...` link.
