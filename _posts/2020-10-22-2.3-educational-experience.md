## Plugin design

This plugin is a sophisticated tool designed to respect student psychology as well as the needs of teachers. The design of the
grading table with a combination of grade item popover supports a positive educational experience.

## Logged in student first

Usability is one of the most important requirements for our work. Many users can be enrolled in your course, so we are always
moving the logged-in user to the first row of the grading table, which ensures a considerable degree of consistency for each user.

## Labels customization

Thanks to the `Passed` and `Failed` labels customization, a more polite and gentle communication of feedback can be provided,
especially if the student failed the graded activity. As a result, the `Failed` status will not have such an impact on the
student's demotivation.
