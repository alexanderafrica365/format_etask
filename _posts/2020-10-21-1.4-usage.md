## Change course format

For the existing course just go to `Course administration` / `Edit settings`. Scroll to the `Course format` section and change
`Format` to the `eTask topics format`. You can change additional course format settings as well - for more information, visit the
[settings]({{ "/1-get-started/1.3-settings/" | absolute_url }}) tutorial.

If you are creating the new course, scroll to the `Course format` section and change `Format` to the `eTask topics format` during 
the new course definition.

## Enroll the students

If you are creating a new course, the grading table is empty by default.

![No students, no grade items]({{ "/images/usage/no-students-no-grade-items.png" | absolute_url }})

What you need is to have some students enrolled in the course.

![No grade items]({{ "/images/usage/no-grade-items.png" | absolute_url }})

## Add gradable activities

For the new course, it is necessary to add some gradable activities to use the full potential of the eTask topics format.
Otherwise, the grading table is empty or only enrolled users are shown.
