## From version 2.0

We started to support the formatting of grade value so that you can easily recalculate `Grade to pass` to the letter, percentage,
etc. automatically. This value is formatted in the grading table as well as the grade item popover. See
[how to set up the formatting of grade value]({{ "/4-common-problems/4.5-format-grade-value/" | absolute_url }}).
