## From version 2.0

Non-editing teachers cannot by default access groups of which they are not a member. In sites that have been upgraded to Moodle 3.2
or later, non-editing teachers do still have this capability by default. Thus, if you only want them to access the groups for which
they are responsible, then
[remove this capability at the course or site level]({{ "/4-common-problems/4.1-groups-access/" | absolute_url }}).
