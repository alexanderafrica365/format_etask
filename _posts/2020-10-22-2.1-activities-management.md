## Unique course format

With the existence of new technologies, the time to access information is constantly shortening. We developed a unique course
format, that includes a grading table with additional functionality so that each student can immediately access his/her grade. But
it is not only about students - we are providing a really strong, time-saving tool to work with the grading items. We removed
unnecessary clicking and you can manage activities completely via grade item popover even if editing mode is turned off in the
course.

2. Grade item shortcut shows grade the item popover on tap/hover.
3. Grade of student's activity refers to the `Edit grade` page (if capabilities, otherwise no link).
4. Groups selector is available if the course contains more groups of which the user is a part.
5. Pagination is available if a lot of students are enrolled.
6. Title of the cell is provided for color understanding.
7. Plugin help popover is available in the grading table footer.

## Grade item popover

1. `Last modified date` is shown to reflect activity changes.
2. Grade item name refers to its detail.
3. `Due date` is provided, if defined.
4. `Grade to pass` with `max.` grade is displayed if the grade to pass is defined.
5. Progress bars `Completed` and `Passed` are available if allowed in plugin settings.
6. Activity `Settings` section with the `Grade to pass` field is shown (if capabilities, otherwise no this section). Grade to pass is
saved automatically on the checkbox change.
