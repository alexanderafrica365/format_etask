## Capability changes

Non-editing teachers do not have the capability `moodle/site:accessallgroups` and so cannot by default access groups of which they
are not a member. The teachers have this capability allowed by default, but you can disallow it â€“ just remove this capability at
the course or site level.

For course level, go to `Course administration` / `Users` / `Permissions` and in the Filter field type
`moodle/site:accessallgroups`. Click to trash icon next to the `Teacher` role to remove this capability.

For site level, go to `Site administration` / `Users` / `Permissions` / `Define roles`. Edit the Teacher role and in the Filter
field type `moodle/site:accessallgroups`. You can see `Access all groups` is allowed so uncheck the checkbox for disallowing and
click the `Save changes` button.
